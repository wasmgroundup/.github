## Learn how WebAssembly works and why it's a big deal.

This book takes a hands-on, bottoms-up approach: you'll go from hand crafting bytecodes to writing a real compiler for a simple programming language.

Forget the hype — get your hands dirty and see for yourself what WebAssembly is all about.

**This book is a work in progress**. The early access price includes:

-   Access to 6 chapters of technical content.
-   Early access to new chapters as they're completed.
-   Membership in our private Discord.

## Our approach

To really understand what WebAssembly is and what makes it special, you need to dive into the low-level details.

We use a hands-on approach to teach you the core of WebAssembly: the instruction set and the module format.

Since WebAssembly is primarily a compilation target, we think the best way to learn the details is by writing a compiler. (Really.)

You'll build a compiler that compiles a simple programming language down to WebAssembly.

The focus is on WebAssembly, _not_ the finer details of parsing. The compiler is built in JavaScript, using [Ohm](https://ohmjs.org), a user-friendly parsing toolkit.

All the code you need is provided in the book. Everything proceeds step by step — in small, logical increments.

## You'll learn...

-   What exactly WebAssembly _is_, and what makes it unique.
-   How to instantiate a WebAssembly module in JavaScript and run its functions.
-   The binary module format, and how to hand craft a module from scratch.
-   How to create a simple compiler with [Ohm](https://ohmjs.org).
-   The instruction set: numeric instructions, memory access, control flow, etc.
-   How to interact with the outside world.
-   The WebAssembly security model: what makes it safe?

## Who should read this book?

The book is mainly targeted at experienced programmers. You don't need to be an expert, but ideally you've been programming for a few years and are fluent in more than one language. For important topics that some readers might not be familiar with, we've included optional _deep dive_ sections to get you up to speed.

In order to understand the code, you'll need at least intermediate knowledge of JavaScript, or a willingness to learn. We try to stick to "the good parts" and to avoid any advanced or obscure features.

You do not need any previous experience with writing a compiler! Our compiler is based on Ohm, a framework that handles the lower-level details of parsing. This lets us keep the focus on WebAssembly.

For some reason, many people believe that writing a compiler is a complex, esoteric task. But we hope to convince you that it's really not.
